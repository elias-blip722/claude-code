## 📱 For iPhone Photos

Your iPhone photos are probably too large for Imgur (max 20MB).

**Before uploading to Imgur, compress them:**

1. Transfer photos from iPhone to computer (AirDrop or iCloud)
2. Go to **https://tinypng.com**
3. Upload your photo
4. Download the compressed version
5. Upload the compressed version to Imgur
6. Get the URL and add to your timeline!

## ✨ Example with Real Photos

```javascript
{
    id: 2,
    date: "2023-02-03",
    title: "Our First Date",
    category: "milestone",
    description: "We walked for hours...",
    location: "Riverside Park",
    tags: ["first date", "butterflies"],
    mood: "nervous and excited",
    quote: "I could talk to you forever",
    icon: "💕",
    photo: "https://i.imgur.com/xyz789.jpg",  // ← Your photo!
    video: ""
},
{
    id: 3,
    date: "2023-02-14",

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Photo Not Showing?

**Check 1:** Is the URL correct?
- Paste the URL into your browser address bar
- You should see JUST the image (no webpage around it)
- URL should end in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`

**Check 2:** Did you use the image link (not the page link)?
- ❌ Wrong: `https://imgur.com/gallery/ABC123`
- ✅ Right: `https://i.imgur.com/ABC123.jpg`

**Check 3:** Make sure you right-clicked and selected "Copy image address"

### Website Not Loading?

**Problem:** Syntax error in the code

**Fix:**
- Check that photo URLs are in quotes: `photo: "URL",`
- Make sure there's a comma after the closing quote
- Make sure the closing `}` is there

**Example - Correct syntax:**
```javascript
{
    id: 1,
    title: "Our Date",
    photo: "https://i.imgur.com/ABC123.jpg",  // ← Comma here!
    video: ""                                  // ← No comma on last field
}
```

## 💾 How Many Photos Can I Add?

**UNLIMITED!** 🎉

Because you're using URLs:
- File stays tiny (62KB)
- Add 5 photos, 50 photos, 500 photos - doesn't matter!
- No email size limits
- No performance issues

## 🎬 For Videos

Videos work the same way:

1. Upload to YouTube or Google Drive
2. Get the direct video link (must be .mp4 file)
3. Add to the `video: ""` field

**Note:** YouTube embeds don't work - you need a direct video file link. For videos, I recommend using Google Drive:

1. Upload video to Google Drive
2. Right-click → "Get link" → "Anyone with the link"
3. Change the URL format (Google for "Google Drive direct video link")

Or just skip videos for now and focus on photos! 📸
