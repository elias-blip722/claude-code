    title: "The First Hello",

    description: "...",

## üì± For iPhone Photos

Your iPhone photos are usually 2-5MB each - too large!

**Before uploading, compress them:**

1. Transfer photos from iPhone to computer (AirDrop or iCloud)

3. Upload your photo
4. Download the compressed version (~200-300KB)
5. Upload the compressed version to ImgBB or Postimages
6. Get the URL and add to your timeline!

## ‚ú® Example with Real Photos

```javascript
{
    id: 2,
    date: "2023-02-03",
    title: "Our First Date",
    category: "milestone",
    description: "We walked for hours...",
    location: "Riverside Park",
    tags: ["first date", "butterflies"],
    mood: "nervous and excited",
    quote: "I could talk to you forever",
    icon: "üíï",
    photo: "https://i.ibb.co/xyz789/photo.jpg",  // ‚Üê Your photo!
    video: ""
},

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Photo Not Showing?

**Check 1:** Is the URL correct?
- Paste the URL into your browser address bar
- You should see JUST the image (no webpage around it)
- URL should end in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`

**Check 2:** Did you use the image link (not the page link)?
- ‚ùå Wrong: Page link with preview
- ‚úÖ Right: Direct image link (ends in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`)

**Check 3:** Make sure you right-clicked and selected "Copy image address"

### Website Not Loading?

**Problem:** Syntax error in the code

**Fix:**
- Check that photo URLs are in quotes: `photo: "URL",`
- Make sure there's a comma after the closing quote
- Make sure the closing `}` is there

**Example - Correct syntax:**
```javascript
{
    id: 1,
    title: "Our Date",
    photo: "https://i.ibb.co/ABC123/photo.jpg",  // ‚Üê Comma here!
    video: ""                                  // ‚Üê No comma on last field
}
```

## üíæ How Many Photos Can I Add?

**UNLIMITED!** üéâ

Because you're using URLs:
- File stays tiny (62KB)
- Add 5 photos, 50 photos, 500 photos - doesn't matter!
- No email size limits
- No performance issues

---

## üé¨ For Videos

Videos work the same way:

1. Upload to YouTube or Google Drive
2. Get the direct video link (must be .mp4 file)
3. Add to the `video: ""` field

**Note:** YouTube embeds don't work - you need a direct video file link. For videos, I recommend using Google Drive:

1. Upload video to Google Drive
2. Right-click ‚Üí "Get link" ‚Üí "Anyone with the link"
3. Change the URL format (Google for "Google Drive direct video link")

Or just skip videos for now and focus on photos! üì∏
